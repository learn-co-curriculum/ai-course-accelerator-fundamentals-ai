## The fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence

### Categories of AI

The fundamentals of AI can be broadly categorized into the following areas:

1.   *Machine Learning*: Machine learning involves the use of algorithms and 
statistical models to enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It encompasses techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

            <li><span><em>Supervised learning</em> is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from labeled data. In this approach, the training dataset consists of input data points and their corresponding correct output or target values. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping function that can predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. The learning algorithm analyzes the labeled examples and generalizes from the patterns it observes to make predictions on unseen data.</span></li>
            <li><span><em>Unsupervised learning</em> is a machine learning approach where the model learns from unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no predetermined target values associated with the input data. The objective of unsupervised learning is to discover patterns, relationships, or structures within the data. The algorithm explores the data's inherent structure and organizes it into meaningful clusters or representations.</span></li>
            <li><span><em>Reinforcement learning</em> is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions and take actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions. The agent's goal is to learn an optimal policy or strategy that maximizes the long-term expected reward. Reinforcement learning is often used in scenarios where the optimal decision-making strategy is not known in advance and needs to be learned through exploration and trial-and-error. A famous example of this is <em>AlphaGo</em>.</span></li>
        </ol>
2.  *Neural Networks*: Neural networks are a subfield of machine learning that simulate the behavior of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) arranged in layers and can learn patterns and relationships from data.
3.  *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*: NLP focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It encompasses tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and speech recognition.
4.  *Computer Vision*: Computer vision involves the development of algorithms and techniques to enable computers to understand and interpret visual information from images or videos. It finds applications in object recognition, image classification, face recognition, and autonomous vehicles.
